The Mental Health Journal and Chatbot Website is a web-based platform designed to help users track their mental well-being and engage with a supportive chatbot. It allows users to write journal entries, record their moods, and chat with a virtual assistant for emotional support, self-care tips, or simply to vent in a safe space.
